creating documents

db.moviesScratch.insertOne{{"title":"rocky"}}
_id is unique identifier
You can use _id by self instead specified by MongoDB.

db.moviesScratch.insertOne{{"title":"rocky", "_id":"xxxxxx"}}

db.moviesScratch.find().pretty() returns two duplicate documents with different ID's

db.moviesScratch.insertMany ( {}, {}, {}  )


To deal problems with insertMany you can use ordered or unordered inserts.  

ordered inserts - the execution of the inserts stops if there is an error.
Unordered inserts - The execution of inserts does not stop if there is an error.

db.moviesScratch.insertMany ( [{}. {}. {} ], {"ordered": false}  )

Update commands can be used for documen creation. upserts are used.
